## Changes
### Items

  - Some values in the class were also rounded up.

- Spawn egg tinting is now controlled by a `tintSpawnEggs` config, although it may not be working correctly.
  - All spawn eggs now have defined colors instead of being pure white.
- Updated the textures of all spawn eggs to match snapshot [25w08a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_25w08a).
- **[Aljan Tex. Update]** Updated the jantical texture to better resemble a crystal.

### Blocks
- Crate's background texture is now a separate texture instead of pointing to `generic_54.png`.
  - It's found at `backmath:textures/gui/container/crate.png`. It's still 9x6, however.

  - Sophie -> Termian ("Termiano" in Portuguese);
  - Fabricio -> Alcalyte ("Alcálito" in Portuguese).
- Updated the texture chiseled aljanstone and sleepingstone (termian) and (alcalyte).

### Entities

### Effects
- Updated the icons of "Mood" and "Patience".

### Miscellaneous
- Updated the mod's description to update the changelogs location.
  - Changelogs are now found [here (in this repository)](/Back%20Math/Changelogs) instead of within the [mod's assets](https://github.com/isabellawoods/Back-Math/blob/915b840c50eae4a99097ecc70a1d9661d1af2f99/src/main/resources/assets/backmath/changelogs/changelog_1.8.txt) (actual file location in the original description never existed).
- Updated the mod's display URL to point to a valid repository.
- When using **The Mato's Music Pack**, "Broken Clocks" by Amos Roddy can now play in all back fields, and in angelic woods.
- Removed the "Back Math:" prefix from the stack loading error message.
- "Queen Lucy" within the variant loading error message is now uppercase.
- **[Bra. Portuguese]** The word "rainha" within the "set spell" message is now uppercase.

## Technical
### Additions
- The "null effect type" error is now translatable: *"An effect type for item behavior '%s' is null"*.

### Changes
- Renamed the config `aljamicMembersArmorChance` to `alcalyteArmorChance`.
  - Also updated its description to match the renaming of fabricios to alcalytes.
- *BreastLayer* can now be rendered on any living entity, and now also checks if `femalegender` is loaded together with `wildfire_gender`.
  - This is because I ported the 1.18 version of the mod to 1.16, and changed the mod id in the process.
- All data-driven mob variants are now located inside a single folder: `data/<namespace>/mob_variants`.
  - These folders no longer have a `_variant` suffix.
- Updated codecs of various classes in *Back Math* (even though they aren't used), and added some new ones.
- Renamed the following methods and classes:

|----------|----------|
| *VSUtils* | *RVUtils* |
| *BMBowItem*`.onPlayerStoppedUsing()` | *BMBowItem*`.shootArrow()` |
